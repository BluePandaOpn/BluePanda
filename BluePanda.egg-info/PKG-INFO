﻿# BluePanda Engine

BluePanda is a 2D game engine in Python built on top of Pygame, using a node-and-component architecture powered by decorators.

Current version: `v0.10`

## Goals

- Fast 2D prototyping.
- Simple API (`Nodo2D`, `run_game`, `Config`).
- Plug-and-play components: movement, collisions, physics, UI, timers, scripts.
- Advanced runtime systems: SceneTree groups, pause modes, time scaling, gameplay mixins.

## Requirements

- Python `3.10+`
- `pygame`

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Alternative install (non-editable):

```bash
pip install .
```

After installing once, `import BluePanda` works from any project folder.

## Quick Start

```python
from BluePanda import *

class MyConfig(Config):
    width = "1280 px"
    height = "720 px"
    bg_color = Color2d("#14181e")
    fps = 60
    Windows = WindowSettings()
    Windows.Name = "BluePanda Demo"
    Windows.Resizable = True

class Player(Nodo2D):
    @CharacterBody2D
    def movement():
        speed = 220
        input_type = "wasd"

    @Sprite2D
    def look():
        color = (80, 160, 255)
        width = 48
        height = 48

    def update(self):
        super().update()

player = Player(100, 100)
camera = Camera2D(target=player)

run_game(MyConfig)
```
